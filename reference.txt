PROSPECTUS SUMMARY

NetWave Solutions, Inc. is a provider of high-speed broadband connectivity and
internet-based digital services delivered through a privately managed national
IP network. Our services are marketed under the NetWave™ brand and are designed
to provide consistently high availability, low latency, and enhanced multimedia
performance for residential and commercial users.

We put multiple access technologies, including fiber-to-the-building,
enhanced DSL, fixed wireless, and Ethernet-based solutions. Our network
architecture is designed to bypass congestion commonly associated with the
public internet by managing traffic end-to-end.

As of December 31, 2000, we had active service agreements covering approximately
820,000 potential residential and commercial locations. Infrastructure had been
constructed for roughly 55,000 locations, supporting more than 4,600 active
subscribers, representing a penetration rate of approximately 8.4%.

Our national backbone consisted of 34 operational points of presence (POPs)
across 35 metropolitan markets. By the end of fiscal year 2001, we expect to
expand to over 60 POPs serving more than 65 markets nationwide.
