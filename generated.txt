BUSINESS OVERVIEW

SkyBridge Digital Corp. develops and operates managed high-capacity internet access
solutions supported by a privately owned IP backbone. The company focuses on
delivering stable, high-throughput connectivity optimized for modern digital
applications, including streaming media, cloud services, and enterprise workloads.

Rather than relying solely on the public internet, SkyBridge manages traffic across
its own infrastructure, enabling tighter performance control and improved service
consistency. Customer connections are provisioned using a mix of fiber-based access,
licensed microwave links, upgraded copper technologies, and dedicated Ethernet
deployments.

As of June 30, 2002, SkyBridge held long-term access rights covering approximately
1.05 million residential and commercial units. Network construction had been
completed for roughly 81,000 units, supporting 7,420 active subscribers. This
corresponds to an estimated adoption rate of 9.2%.

The core network operated through 48 points of presence located in 50 major U.S.
metro areas. Management expects to increase coverage to nearly 80 points of
presence across more than 85 markets by the end of 2003.
